### Data 605: Actionable Visualization & Analytics

# Introduction 

Traditional sports has become dominated by data and analytics. From the decisions made by a team such as what players to aqurire, how to play, and ... to the debate between fans of who is better than who by comparing their statistics. The same can be said for an much newer, emerging sport known as eSports where people compete against each other virtually. One of the most popular eSports games for the past decade has been League of Legends. I will bring the data-driven debate to the virtual domain to see if some of the age old questions can be answered.

# What is League of Legends?

League of Legends (sometimes refered to as LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena game where two teams of five players each battle against each other with the goal of destroying the enemy team's base (called the Nexus) while defending their own. Players choose from a roster of over 150 unique champions with different abilities and play styles to strategically coordinate attacks and defenses in real-time combat. 

The arena has 4 main sections. Top lane, Middle lane, Bottom lane, and the area between each lanes are called the Jungle.

Each team's players are assigned to a different position:
- Top: This player will spend most of the game in the top lane.
- Middle: This player will spend most of the game in the top lane.
- Jungle: This player will spend most of the game in the Jungle moving between all ofthe lanes to help their teammates.
- Damage and Support: Both of these players spend most of the game in the bottom lane together.

# What is League of Legends E-sports?
Now that we understand the basics of the game, what does the competitve scene look like?

There are 4 main regions (leagues):
- South Korea (LCK)
- China (LPL)
- Europe (LEC)
- North America (LCS)

The teams in each region compete against each other throughout the season, broken up into two splits (Spring and Summer). At the end of spring and summer, a team is crowned the champion of their respective region. In between the spring and summer, the top teams of each region are invited to an international tournament called the Mid Season Invitational (MSI) to compete against each other to see who is the best in the world. At the end of the season, the best teams for each region qualify for the World Championship where all teams compete to see who is the best in League of Legends for that season. 

Visually, a League of Legends season will look like this:
- Spring Split (domestic)
- Mid Season Invitiational (International)
- Summer Split (domestic)
- World Championship (International)
